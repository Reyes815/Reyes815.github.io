          <h2>Algorun</h2>
          <p>
            My first mobile development project using android studio and Java. 
            Algorun was made with my project partner Lyra Versoza as we made several features like: Color themes, Program Language switching, Quizzes, Guides and many more. 
            We wanted a mobile app that could teach beginners basic concepts on different programming algorithms.

          <h2>StudyGuru</h2>
          <p>
            This was my second mobile development project that focused on a gamified learning experience with regards to Deterministic Finite Automata. 
            The user gets to learn and play as they navigate the tower to reach the top. 
            This project was made with 2 other members namely: Gian Lariosa and Venn Dominic.

          <h2>Neural Networks</h2>
          <p>
            This project was my gateway to learning and implementing AI. 
            It made me realize that AI is not as scary of a topic to learn and can be done well with proper guidance. 
            I learned about neural networks and all the little parts that come along with it.

          <h2>GenerateUX</h2>
          <p>
            This was my second web development project using JavaScript that centered around diagram conversion particularly Activity Diagrams to State Diagrams. 
            I applied the different css/scss techniques that I learned and improved upon what I knew.

          <h2>AI forecasting</h2>
          <p>
            This project is still in progress for our final research output. 
            It involves using 3 different AI models that focused on forecasting sales data based on csv provided by the user. 
            This is still a work in progress so somethings may change
